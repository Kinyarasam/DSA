# Arrays
## What is an Array?
An **array** is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by atleast one index or key. Arrays can hold elements of the same data type such as integers, characters or objects.

## Key characteristics of Arrays:
1. **Fixed Size**: In most programming languages, arrays have a fizd size, meaning the number of elements they can store is determined when they are created. 
2. **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: Elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient memory access and iteration through elements
3. **Zero-based indexing**: The index of the first index of the first element is 0, the second element is at index 1...
4. **Random Access**: Arrays support constant time access to elements by index. This means you can access any element in the array directly by its index without having to iterate through the entire array.

## Basic Operations of Arrays.
1. **Accessing Elements**: You can access the elements of the array using their index.
2. **Insertion**: Adding elements to an array involves specifying the index where the new element should be inserted and shifting existing elements, if necessary, to make space for new element.
3. **Deletion**: Removing elements from an array involves specifying the index of the element to be removed and shifting subsequent elements, if necessary, to fill the gap left by the removed element.
4. **Traversal**: Iterating through all elements of an array is a common operation. This can be done using loops such as `for` loops or `while` loops.
