## Overview

This section of the project focuses on Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started

To start using the Python implementations in this project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the `python/` directory in the project repository.

2. Explore the following directories:
   - `data_structures/`: Contains Python implementations of common data structures.
   - `algorithms/`: Includes Python implementations of various algorithms.
   - `examples/`: Provides usage examples for data structures and algorithms.
   - `tests/`: Contains unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

3. Refer to the respective README files in each subdirectory for detailed information on using the code.

## Usage Guidelines

When using the Python implementations in this project, please follow these guidelines:

- Always import modules/classes/functions from the relevant Python files.
- Make use of docstrings and comments to document your code and explain your logic.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation when necessary.
- Be mindful of time and space complexity when using algorithms for large datasets.
- Follow best practices for data structure manipulation and algorithm utilization.

## Coding Style

We follow Python's PEP 8 style guide for code style and formatting. It's essential to maintain a consistent and readable codebase. You can use the `pycodestyle` tool to check your code for PEP 8 compliance:

```bash
pycodestyle your_code.py
```
## Testing
Testing is crucial to ensure the correctness of Python implementations. We use the unittest framework for unit testing. You can run the tests in the tests/ directory using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
Make sure your code passes all tests before submitting contributions.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the Python implementations of data structures and algorithms in this project. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch for your contribution.

3. Make your changes, add tests, and ensure your code passes all tests.

4. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

5. Follow the project's [contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for code review and feedback.

Thank you for your contributions to the Data Structures and Algorithms project in Python!
