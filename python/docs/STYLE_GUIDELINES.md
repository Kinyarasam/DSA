# Coding Style Guidelines
These coding style guidelines are intended to maintain a consistent and readable codebase for the Data Structures and Algorithms project. All contributors are expected to follow these guidelines when making changes to the code.

## General
- **Consistency**: Be consistent with existing code. Follow the style and conventions used in the project.

- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names.

- **Modularity**: Encapsulate functionality in functions and classes. Keep functions and methods focused on a single task.

## Naming Conventions
- **Variables and Functions**: Use lowercase letters with underscores for variable and function names (snake_case).
~~~
# Good
variable_name = 42
def calculate_average(numbers_list):
    # ...
~~~

- **Classes**: Use CamelCase for class names.
~~~
Copy code
# Good
class LinkedList:
    # ...
~~~

- **Constants**: Use uppercase letters with underscores for constants.
~~~
# Good
MAX_VALUE = 100
~~~

- **Module Names**: Use lowercase letters for module names.
~~~
# Good
import my_module
~~~

## Formatting
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 80 characters whenever possible.

- **Whitespace**: Use a single space after commas and around operators.
~~~
# Good
x = 10
y = 20
result = x + y
~~~

## Documentation
- **Docstrings**: Provide docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules to explain their purpose and usage.
~~~
def calculate_average(numbers_list):
    """Calculate the average of a list of numbers."""
    # ...
~~~

- **Comments**: Use comments sparingly but effectively to explain complex logic or why certain code decisions were made.

- **PEP 8 and pycodestyle**: Follow the guidelines outlined in PEP 8 for Python code style. You can use the pycodestyle tool to check your code for PEP 8 compliance.

## Version Control
- **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Each commit should have a single, well-defined purpose.

- **Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Follow a clear branch naming convention.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for new code and ensure existing tests pass.

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage to catch potential issues early.

- **Continuous Integration**: Use CI/CD tools to automate testing and code analysis.

## PEP 8 and pycodestyle
PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. It covers a wide range of topics, including naming conventions, indentation, and code layout. We recommend following PEP 8 for Python code in this project.

You can use the `pycodestyle` tool to check your code for PEP 8 compliance. To run `pycodestyle` on your code, you can use the following command:
~~~
pycodestyle your_code.py
~~~
By adhering to PEP 8 and using `pycodestyle`, you can ensure that your code is consistent and follows best practices for Python development.

## Conclusion
By following these coding style guidelines, including PEP 8 and `pycodestyle`, we can maintain a clean and organized codebase that is easy for everyone to work with. Thank you for your commitment to following these guidelines when contributing to the Data Structures and Algorithms project.
