## Introduction

In this project, we provide clear and well-commented implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Understanding and implementing these concepts are crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference for practical coding.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- **data_structures**: This directory contains implementations of common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **algorithms**: Here, you'll find various algorithms including sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), and more.
- **examples**: This directory contains usage examples and test cases to help you understand how to use the data structures and algorithms provided.
- **contributions**: We welcome contributions! If you have additional data structures or algorithms you'd like to add or if you find and fix issues, please follow our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
