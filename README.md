## Introduction

In this project, we provide clear and well-commented implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Understanding and implementing these concepts are crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference for practical coding.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by programming language:

- **Python**: Python implementations of data structures and algorithms.

Each language-specific directory follows a similar structure with subdirectories for data structures, algorithms, examples, tests, and documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Choose a programming language directory (e.g., `python/`, `java/`, etc.) that you're interested in.

2. Explore the data structures and algorithms available in that language's directory.

3. Check the examples and usage instructions to understand how to use the code.

4. Refer to the specific language's documentation in the respective directory for more details on using the code.

## Documentation

- [Python Documentation](python/docs/README.md)

Each language directory contains detailed documentation specific to that language, including usage guidelines and style recommendations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to improve this project in any programming language. To contribute, please follow the contribution guidelines provided in each language-specific documentation.
